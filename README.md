#Tidy Data Assignment - README
Jake, 19/11/2015


This repo contains two other files, "run\_analysis.R" and "CodeBook.md", which produces a tidy data set as specified in the course project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course offered by Coursera. By running the run\_analysis R script we are assuming that the (provided) Samsung data is in your working directory. The function and output of this script is described in the "CodeBook.md" file.
